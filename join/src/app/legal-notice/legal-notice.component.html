        <li>Conclusion</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Introduction and Overview</h3>
      <p>
        We have created this privacy policy (version 24.06.2025-323017699) to explain to you, 
        in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 
        and applicable national laws, what personal data (data for short) we as data controllers â€“ 
        and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) â€“ process, will process in the future, 
        and what lawful options you have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br />
        In short: We provide you with comprehensive information about data that we process about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal jargon. This privacy policy, 
        on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and 
        transparently as possible. As far as it promotes transparency, technical terms are explained 
        in a reader-friendly way, links to further information are provided and graphics are used. 
        We thus inform in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the course 
        of our business activities when there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not 
        possible if one gives the most concise, unclear and legal-technical explanations possible, 
        as they are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you 
        find the following explanations interesting and informative and maybe there is some 
        information that you did not know yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        If questions still remain, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body 
        mentioned below or in the legal notice, to follow the existing links and to look at 
        further information on third-party sites. Our contact details can of course also be 
        found in the legal notice.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope of Application</h3>
      <p>
        This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and 
        to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal 
        data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR such as the name, 
        email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures 
        that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. 
        The scope of this privacy policy includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
        <li>Social media presences and email communication</li>
        <li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed 
        in a structured manner in the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into 
        legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately 
        if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal Basis</h3>
      <p>
        In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information about the 
        legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection 
        Regulation, which enable us to process personal data. As far as EU law is concerned, 
        we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 
        27 April 2016. You can of course read this General Data Protection Regulation of the EU 
        online on EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at 
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679" 
           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR):</b> You have given us your consent 
          to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of your 
          entered data from a contact form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Contract (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR):</b> In order to fulfill a contract 
          or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we 
          conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legal obligation (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR):</b> If we are subject to 
          a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to 
          keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR):</b> In the case of 
          legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the 
          right to process personal data. For example, we must process certain data in order 
          to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is 
          therefore a legitimate interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other conditions such as the performance of recordings in the public interest and 
        exercise of public authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not 
        usually occur with us. If such a legal basis should nevertheless be relevant, this 
        will be shown at the appropriate place.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:<br />
        In Austria, this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard 
        to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act), DSG for short.<br />
        In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) applies.<br />
        If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about this in the 
        following sections.
      </p>

      <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
      <p>
        The fact that we only store personal data for as long as it is absolutely necessary 
        for the provision of our services and products applies as a general criterion for us. 
        This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for data processing no 
        longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after 
        the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.<br />
        Should you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, 
        the data will be deleted as quickly as possible and insofar as there is no obligation 
        to store it.<br />
        We will inform you about the specific duration of the respective data processing below, 
        provided we have further information about it.
      </p>

      <h3>Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h3>
      <p>
        In accordance with Articles 13, 14 GDPR, we inform you of the following rights that 
        you have so that fair and transparent processing of data takes place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          According to Article 15 GDPR, you have a right of access as to whether we process 
          data from you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data 
          and to learn the following information:
          <ul>
            <li>for what purpose we carry out the processing;</li>
            <li>the categories, i.e. the types of data, that are processed;</li>
            <li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;</li>
            <li>how long the data is stored;</li>
            <li>the existence of the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;</li>
            <li>that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li>
            <li>the origin of the data if we did not collect it from you;</li>
            <li>whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to arrive at a personal profile of you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 16 GDPR, you have a right to rectification of data, which means 
          that we must correct data if you find errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), 
          which specifically means that you may request the deletion of your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, 
          which means that we may only store the data but not use it further.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means 
          that we will provide you with your data in a common format upon request.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right to object, which, after enforcement, 
          entails a change in processing.
          <ul>
            <li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6 para. 1 lit. e (public interest, exercise of public authority) or Article 6 para. 1 lit. f (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
            <li>If data is used to conduct direct marketing, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.</li>
            <li>If data is used to conduct profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for profiling.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 22 GDPR, under certain circumstances you have the right not to 
          be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (for example profiling).
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means 
          you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that 
          the processing of personal data violates the GDPR.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short: You have rights â€“ do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed 
        above with us!

      <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
      <p>
        Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data. Below we explain what cookies 
        are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers are, for example, 
        Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small 
        text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful helpers. Almost all websites use 
        cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other 
        areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our 
        website. These cookie files are automatically placed in the cookie folder, which is like 
        the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a 
        cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.

        <b>Single Sign-On Logins Privacy Policy Summary</b><br />
        Affected: Visitors to the website<br />
        Purpose: Simplification of the authentication process<br />
        Processed data: Depends heavily on the respective provider, usually email address and 
        username can be stored. More details can be found with the tool used in each case.<br />
        Storage duration: depends on the tools used<br />
        Legal basis: Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR

      </p>

      <h4>What are Single Sign-On logins?</h4>
      <p>
        On our website, you have the option of quickly and easily registering for our online 
        service via a user account from another provider (e.g. via Facebook). This authentication 
        procedure is called, among other things, "single sign-on login". This login procedure 
        naturally only works if you are registered with the other provider or have a user account 
        and enter the corresponding access data in the online form. In many cases, you are already 
        logged in, the access data is automatically entered in the form and you only have to 
        confirm the single sign-on login with a button. In the course of this login, personal 
        data from you can also be processed and stored. In this privacy text, we generally deal 
        with data processing through single sign-on logins. You can find more detailed information 
        in the privacy policies of the respective providers.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Congratulations! If you are reading these lines, you have really "fought" your way 
        through our entire privacy policy or at least scrolled down to here. As you can see 
        from the scope of our privacy policy, we do not take the protection of your personal 
        data lightly.<br />
        It is important to us to inform you about the processing of personal data to the best 
        of our knowledge and belief. We don't just want to tell you what data is processed, 
        but also want to bring you closer to the reasons for using various software programs. 
        As a rule, privacy policies sound very technical and legal. Since most of you are not 
        web developers or lawyers, we also wanted to take a different linguistic approach and 
        explain the facts in simple and clear language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this is not always possible due to the subject matter. Therefore, the most 
        important terms are explained in more detail at the end of the privacy policy.<br />
        If you have any questions about data protection on our website, please do not hesitate 
        to contact us or the responsible body. We wish you a wonderful time and hope to welcome 
        you to our website again soon.
